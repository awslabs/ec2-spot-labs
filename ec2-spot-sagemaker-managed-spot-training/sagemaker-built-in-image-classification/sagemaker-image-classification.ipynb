    "SageMaker Image Classification algorithm also supports running real-time inference with Amazon Elastic Inference (EI), a resource you can attach to your Amazon EC2 instances to accelerate your deep learning (DL) inference workloads. EI allows you to add inference acceleration to a hosted endpoint for a fraction of the cost of using a full GPU instance. Add an appropriate EI or accelerator type in addition to a CPU instance type and the model to the production variant when creating the endpoint configuration that you use to deploy a hosted endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, an `ml.eia1.large` EI is attached along with `ml.m4.xlarge` instance type to the production variant while creating the endpoint configuration."
