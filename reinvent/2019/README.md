## What to expect in each type of session

**Breakout Sessions**

> re:Invent breakout sessions are lecture style and 60 minutes long. These sessions will take place throughout the re:Invent campus and cover all topics at all levels (200–400). Sessions are delivered by AWS experts, customers, and partners, and they typically include 10–15 minutes at the end for Q&A.

**Workshops**

> Workshops are two-hour, hands-on sessions where you work in teams to solve problems using AWS. Workshops organize attendees into small groups and provide scenarios to encourage interaction, giving you the opportunity to learn from and teach each other. Each workshop starts with a 10–15-minute lecture by the main speaker, and the rest of the time is spent working as a group. AWS will provide credits.

**Builders Sessions**

> Builders Sessions are 60-minute small groups sessions with up to five customers and one AWS expert, who is there to help, answer questions, and provide guidance. You will use your laptop to experiment and build with the AWS expert after a short demonstration. There is reserved seating for builders sessions. 

**Chalk Talks**

> Chalk talks are a highly interactive content format with a smaller audience. They begin with a 10–15-minute lecture delivered by an AWS expert, followed by a 45–50-minute Q&A session with the audience. The goal is to foster a technical discussion around real-world architecture challenges. Chalk talks are one hour and are presented by AWS experts. They have expert level content.
